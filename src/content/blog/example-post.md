# Building The Number: A PWA Journey

This is an example blog post demonstrating the markdown format for FOIL Engineering blog posts.

## The Challenge

Modern financial tools often overcomplicate simple needs. We wanted to build something elegant, focused, and genuinely useful.

## Our Approach

We chose to build a Progressive Web App using:
- **Vue 3** for reactive UI components
- **Vuetify 3** for Material Design components
- **FastAPI** backend with encrypted SQLite storage
- **The Number Design System** - sage green, warm white, soft charcoal palette

## Key Learnings

1. **Mobile-first is essential** - 65% of users access financial tools on mobile
2. **WCAG compliance matters** - Accessibility benefits everyone
3. **Simple beats complex** - Focus on the core value proposition

## What's Next

We're continuing to iterate based on user feedback and best practices in PWA development.
